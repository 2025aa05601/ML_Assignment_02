# ML Assignment 2 – Classification Models & Streamlit Deployment

## Problem Statement
Build and deploy multiple ML classification models using a single dataset and demonstrate them via a Streamlit web application.

## Dataset Description


## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest (Ensemble)
- XGBoost (Ensemble)

## Model Performance Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|-----|---------|-----|----------|-------|----|----|
| Logistic Regression | | | | | | |
| Decision Tree | | | | | | |
| KNN | | | | | | |
| Naive Bayes | | | | | | |
| Random Forest | | | | | | |
| XGBoost | | | | | | |

## Observations

| Model | Observation |
|-----|-------------|
| Logistic Regression | Performs well on linear boundaries |
| Decision Tree | Overfits without pruning |
| KNN | Sensitive to scaling |
| Naive Bayes | Fast but assumes independence |
| Random Forest | Stable & robust |
| XGBoost | Best overall performance |

## Deployment
Deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.
